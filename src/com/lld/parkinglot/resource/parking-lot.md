Designing a Parking Lot System using UML involves creating a class diagram that represents the various classes, their attributes, and the relationships between them. Here's a basic example:

1. **ParkingLotSystem**: This class represents the overall parking lot system.

2. **ParkingLot**: Represents a single parking lot, which contains multiple parking spots.

3. **ParkingSpot**: Represents a single parking spot in the parking lot.

4. **Vehicle**: Represents a vehicle that can park in the parking lot.

5. **ParkingTicket**: Represents a ticket issued to a vehicle when it enters the parking lot.

6. **Payment**: Represents the payment made by a vehicle to exit the parking lot.

Here's how the classes might be represented in a UML class diagram:

```
+-------------------------------------+
|            ParkingLotSystem         |
+-------------------------------------+
| - parkingLots: List<ParkingLot>     |
+-------------------------------------+
| + displayAvailableSpots(): void     |
| + parkVehicle(vehicle: Vehicle): ParkingTicket |
| + processPayment(ticket: ParkingTicket, payment: Payment): void |
+-------------------------------------+

+-------------------------------------+
|             ParkingLot              |
+-------------------------------------+
| - name: String                      |
| - capacity: int                     |
| - availableSpots: List<ParkingSpot> |
+-------------------------------------+
| + getAvailableSpots(): int          |
| + addParkingSpot(spot: ParkingSpot): void |
+-------------------------------------+

+-------------------------------------+
|            ParkingSpot              |
+-------------------------------------+
| - id: int                           |
| - isOccupied: boolean               |
+-------------------------------------+
| + isOccupied(): boolean             |
| + occupy(): void                    |
| + vacate(): void                    |
+-------------------------------------+

+-------------------------------------+
|              Vehicle                |
+-------------------------------------+
| - licensePlate: String              |
| - type: VehicleType                 |
+-------------------------------------+

+-------------------------------------+
|           ParkingTicket             |
+-------------------------------------+
| - id: int                           |
| - vehicle: Vehicle                  |
| - parkingSpot: ParkingSpot          |
| - entryTime: DateTime               |
+-------------------------------------+

+-------------------------------------+
|             Payment                 |
+-------------------------------------+
| - id: int                           |
| - ticket: ParkingTicket             |
| - amount: double                    |
+-------------------------------------+
```

This is a basic example, and depending on the complexity of your parking lot system, you may need to add more classes or attributes to accurately represent your system.

For the `ParkingLot` class and its relationships in UML, we can represent it as follows:

1. **Class Diagram**:
   ```
   +-----------------------------------+
   |            ParkingLot            |
   +-----------------------------------+
   | - name: String                    |
   | - capacity: int                   |
   | - availableSpots: List<ParkingSpot> |
   +-----------------------------------+
   | + getCapacity(): int              |
   | + getAvailableSpots(): int        |
   | + parkVehicle(vehicle: Vehicle): ParkingTicket |
   | + vacateSpot(ticket: ParkingTicket): void |
   +-----------------------------------+
   ```

2. **Associations**:
    - `ParkingLot` has a 1-to-many association with `ParkingSpot` (1 `ParkingLot` has many `ParkingSpots`).
    - `ParkingLot` uses `Vehicle` and `ParkingTicket` classes.

3. **Dependencies**:
    - `ParkingLot` class depends on `Vehicle` and `ParkingTicket` classes for its methods.

4. **Composition**:
    - `ParkingLot` owns `ParkingSpot` instances (composition relationship), as the spots are created along with the `ParkingLot` and are destroyed with it.

5. **Aggregation**:
    - Aggregation can also be used to represent the relationship between `ParkingLot` and `ParkingSpot`, but composition is more appropriate if the spots are part of the lot's lifecycle.

Here's how you can represent these relationships visually in a class diagram:

```
            +-----------------------------------+
            |            ParkingLot            |
            +-----------------------------------+
            | - name: String                    |
            | - capacity: int                   |
            | - availableSpots: List<ParkingSpot> |
            +-----------------------------------+
            | + getCapacity(): int              |
            | + getAvailableSpots(): int        |
            | + parkVehicle(vehicle: Vehicle): ParkingTicket |
            | + vacateSpot(ticket: ParkingTicket): void |
            +-----------------------------------+
                        |
                        |1
                        |
            +-----------------------------------+
            |           ParkingSpot             |
            +-----------------------------------+
            | - id: int                         |
            | - isOccupied: boolean             |
            +-----------------------------------+
```

This diagram represents the `ParkingLot` class with its attributes and methods, along with its relationship with the `ParkingSpot` class.

To create a flowchart for the allocation process described in your code, we can outline the main steps and decisions involved in finding an available parking spot for a vehicle. Here is a textual representation of the flowchart:

1. **Start**
2. **Input**: List of parking spots, vehicle
3. **Initialize**: Set `foundSpot` to `null`
4. **For each spot in spots**:
    - **Check**: Is the spot occupied?
        - **Yes**: Move to the next spot
        - **No**:
            - **Check**: Does the spot type match the vehicle type?
                - **Yes**: Set `foundSpot` to the current spot and break the loop
                - **No**: Move to the next spot
5. **Output**: Return `foundSpot` (either a parking spot or `null` if no spot is found)
6. **End**

Here's how this would look in a flowchart format:

```
Start
  |
  v
Input: List of parking spots, vehicle
  |
  v
Initialize foundSpot = null
  |
  v
For each spot in spots:
  |   |
  |   v
  |  Is spot occupied?
  |   |
  |   |--> Yes --> Next spot
  |   |
  |   |--> No
  |       |
  |       v
  |      Does spot type match vehicle type?
  |       |
  |       |--> Yes --> foundSpot = spot --> Break loop
  |       |
  |       |--> No --> Next spot
  |
  v
Return foundSpot
  |
  v
End
```

This flowchart provides a clear visual representation of the allocation logic:
- Start with input data.
- Initialize necessary variables.
- Iterate through each spot, checking conditions.
- Update and break as necessary.
- Return the result.

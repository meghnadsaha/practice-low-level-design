Yes, that's a correct interpretation of the relationships in the class diagram:

- A `Guest` can have multiple `Reservation` instances, establishing a one-to-many relationship.
- A `Room` can be part of multiple `Reservation` instances, indicating another one-to-many relationship.
- Each `Reservation` belongs to one `Guest` and one `Room`, forming a many-to-one relationship with both `Guest` and `Room`.
- The `Payment` class is abstract, serving as a base class for specific payment methods like `CashPayment`, `CreditCardPayment`, and `OnlinePayment`.
- The `HotelManagementSystem` uses a `ReentrantLock` for thread safety, ensuring that operations on the system are synchronized.

This diagram provides a solid foundation for understanding the basic structure and relationships within your hotel management system.
